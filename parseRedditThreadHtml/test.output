What do you think about hosting videoconferences regularly to talk about Bioinformatics? (monthly?) The video part is mostly to show slides or something, but it could be audio only too.We could do it so that at every conference, someone talks about what they&#39;ve been doing and the others make questions/comments/suggestions and then, during the next meeting, another person presents what they&#39;re doing and so on.. There are some out there (check out OMGenomics on YouTube). More would be good though.. Department seminars, institution seminars, phd+postdoc seminars, lab meetings, public seminars, conferences, special invited talks. I mean you do you man, but crikey there&#39;s enough already and that&#39;s all without actually doing any work or reading papers.. I would like to join if this becomes reality. Thank your for the support. If this post gets more replies, that idea could really become reality.. I am interested.. I would love to listen in if this became a thing. . That sounds like it could be fun if well executed. I&#39;d definitely check it out!. Well, I think it is clear that there are people interested in participating. Is anyone up to be the first one to present something? .
